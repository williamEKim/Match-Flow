Welcome to "Match Flow .GG" 

We meticulously analyze sub-data from professional players, combining it with OpenAI's new API technology. 

At Match Flow. GG, we are revolutionizing the way we understand and predict the outcomes of tennis matches. Leveraging the power of TennisAbstract's comprehensive data on ATP Top 50 Men players, we delve deep into the nuances of their serve performance a critical and game-defining aspect at the pinnacle of professional tennis.

Our approach is both unique and rigorous. MF.GG uses Multiple Linear Regression (a.k.a. MLR) algorithm integrated with GPT3.5 Turbo API to process regression Logic.

This fusion of machine learning and AI technology enables us to process complex regression logic, offering predictions with unprecedented accuracy and precision.

The tennis serve is a very important metric when playing at the professional tennis level. 
We combined the sub-data of professionals and Open AI's API technology and applied it to the Multi-Linear Regression algorithm to enable very accurate and precise predictions.

We believe that we can solve not only tennis serves, but also a variety of problems with the principles of logical design and the strategic application of algorithms, particularly when merged with AI technologies. Thank you!
